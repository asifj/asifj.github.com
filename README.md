<h3> Multi-modal combination and phase-synchronization of transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation</h3>
As a result of my interest in engineering and neuromodulation, I developed a novel electrical brain stimulation protocol that could engage with the intrinsic electrical activity and properties of the human brain (i.e., the rhythmic oscillations and electrical potentials generated by neurons and measured from the scalp). A major limitation in the current state-of-the-art non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as rTMS is that their effects on the brain's natural rhythmic neural oscillatory activity are non-specific to the actual oscillating frequency of neural activity in the brain. As such, we used tACS to investigate whether we could make frequency-specific changes of rTMS longer-lasting. As part of a highly competitive EU-funded research grant, I led and developed a project to design and develop a more robust stimulation protocol that can more effectively engage with intrinsic neuro-oscillatory activity and induce frequency-specific, long-lasting changes in oscillations. Our solution leveraged computational modeling to define anatomical targets, along with electrical and software engineering to produce a custom phase-synchronized stimulation protocol which leveraged both rTMS and tACS to induce and stabilize frequency-specific oscillatory activity in the brain. Furthermore, we showed that this protocol was also able to enhance functional effects in executive functioning (i.e., working memory processing).

<h3> Data-Driven EEG Biomarker Discovery using Machine Learning and EEG targeting using Neuromodulation</h3>

My ongoing work involves building computational neuroimaging processing pipelines that process all of ongoing neuromodulation clinical trials, including those in major depression (MDD), ADHD, OCD, Alzheimer’s Disease, and substance-use disorders (SUDs). My recent research findings have identified EEG-based neurophysiological signatures underlying these diseases, which has led me to explore their potential use in therapeutic stimulation targeting. Consequently, I am interested in designing and optimizing neuromodulation protocols to effectively engage these respective circuits, using EEG to guide the temporal aspects of stimulation (e.g., timing, duration, frequency, etc.). The broader goal is to develop a “temporal precision” framework of neuromodulation development, whereby stimulation protocols can be tailored to target and modulate the temporal dynamics of brain activity in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders.

<h3> Clinical and translational application of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric disorders</h3>
Another aspect of my research has been focused on developing neuromodulation as a tool for functional rehabilitation, and thereby as an applied treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
